# Coral/OS
An incomplete implementation of the operating system shown in Philipp Oppermann's Rust Operating System blog (second version) with some minor changes e.g. colours or welcome text (that is to say, no differences in features/ functionality at a given point in the blog).
Once finished, the plan is either to extend the project slightly or start from scratch.
