# Coral/OS on [random-vga-text-mode-colours](https://github.com/InfinityMTG1/Coral-OS-RPOV2-1/tree/random-vga-text-mode-colours)
An incomplete implementation of the operating system shown in Philipp Oppermann's Rust Operating System blog (second version) with some minor changes e.g. colours or welcome text (that is to say, no differences in features/ functionality at a given point in the blog).
Once finished, the plan is either to extend the project slightly or start from scratch. <br>
This is a special version on branch which produces a random output in the VGA Text Mode buffer as quickly as possible on loop.
It will not be developed further probably, I just thought it was neat.
